## How to use
On github :

  * fork the project
  * clone the project on your machine
	
Then on your console :


	$ npm i
	$ node index.js

## How it works
The program gets your IP adress to be able to locate your machine and show the weather predictions for the location of your machine.
The predictions are powered by Forecast.io
